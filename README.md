# Chemical Process Optimization with Central Composite Design (CCD)

This project focuses on optimizing a chemical production process using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Central Composite Design (CCD). The objective is to maximize the conversion rate and efficiency of a chemical reaction by studying the influence of three key factors: reaction time, temperature, and catalyst concentration.

## 📌 Project Overview

Using RSM and CCD techniques, we modeled and analyzed a chemical process to:
- Determine the optimal levels of input variables.
- Understand interactions between variables.
- Maximize output response (conversion % and activity).

## 🧪 Process Variables
- **A — Time:** 40–50 minutes  
- **B — Temperature:** 80–90°C  
- **C — Catalyst Concentration:** 2%–3%  

## 📊 Methodology

- **Design Type:** Central Composite Design (CCD)
- **Software Used:** Design Expert, Minitab
- **Models Evaluated:** Linear, 2-Factor Interaction, Quadratic, Cubic
- **Best Model:** Quadratic model, selected based on p-values, R² metrics, and fit statistics.

## 🔍 Key Results

- **Adjusted R²:** 0.8881  
- **Predicted R²:** 0.7891  
- **Conversion Peak:** ~90% at optimal settings  
- **Validated via Confirmation Runs** with high correlation to predicted outcomes
